## Installation
Just make the script executable and put it in your $PATH
## Usage
yta [artist] [album] [url]

WARNING: Only use the script in a completely empty directory! If you do not heed this warning very bad things might happen to your computer. Feel very free to submit a pull request if you make it more safe. I have not touched this script in a long time.
